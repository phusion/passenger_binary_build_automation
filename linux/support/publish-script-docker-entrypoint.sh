# Note that we do not use gpg-agent inside Docker. The reason is as follows.
#
# GPG passes the current TTY's name to pinentry, and pinentry tries to
# read the password from that TTY. But Docker sets its environment up
# in such a way that the filename of the TTY's filename refers to a
# nonexistant file.
#
# It even looks like real TTYs don't exist inside a Docker container.
# Since pinentry is run from gpg-agent, and gpg-agent is daemonized,
# there is no way for pinentry to get a hold on the original TTY.
# The loopback mode works around this problem.
#
# I tried setting pinentry to loopback mode as described here...
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36356924/not-a-tty-error-in-alpine-based-duplicity-image
# ...but it didn't work. Why it didn't work is unknown: I stopped
# bothering investigating it further.
